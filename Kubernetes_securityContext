Security Contexts

The securityContext in Kubernetes allows you to set security-related settings for a container or a pod. These settings include running the container as a specific user, group, or with specific Linux capabilities. Here's an example of an Nginx deployment file with a security context:


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
