A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. As nodes are added or removed from the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically adjusts the number of pods to match the current set of nodes.


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest


apiVersion: Specifies the API version. In this case, it's apps/v1, indicating the Apps API version.

kind: Specifies the type of resource, which is DaemonSet in this case.

metadata: Contains information about the metadata of the DaemonSet, such as its name.

spec: Describes the desired state of the DaemonSet.

selector: Defines how the DaemonSet identifies which nodes to run on. In this example, it matches nodes with the label app: nginx.

template: Specifies the pod template for the DaemonSet.

metadata: Contains labels for the pods created by the DaemonSet.

spec: Describes the specification of the pods.

containers: Defines the containers within the pod. In this example, it includes a container named nginx-container with the Nginx image.
This DaemonSet ensures that a pod with an Nginx container (nginx-container) is running on each node labeled with app: nginx.
