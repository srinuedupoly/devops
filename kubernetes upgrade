Pre-upgrade Considerations:
Backup:

Before starting the upgrade process, it's crucial to backup critical data, including etcd data, configuration files, and manifests.
Read Release Notes:

Review the release notes for the new Kubernetes version to understand any breaking changes, new features, or considerations for the upgrade.
Testing:

Test the upgrade process in a non-production environment to identify potential issues and ensure a smooth upgrade in the production environment.
Upgrading Control Plane:
Update kubectl:

Ensure that your local kubectl version matches or is compatible with the version of the control plane.

kubectl version --short



Upgrade etcd:

If you are using a separate etcd cluster, upgrade etcd following the etcd upgrade instructions.
Upgrade Control Plane Components:

Upgrade the control plane components (API server, controller manager, scheduler) one by one. This typically involves updating the container image or binaries.


kubectl get nodes  # Ensure all nodes are in a "Ready" state
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets  # Drain node before upgrading
# Upgrade the control plane components (specific steps depend on your installation method)
kubectl uncordon <node-name>  # Uncordon node after upgrade


Upgrading Nodes:
Update Kubernetes Software on Nodes:

Upgrade the Kubernetes software on each node. This might involve updating the kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl binaries.


# On each node
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=<new-version> kubelet=<new-version> kubectl=<new-version>



Run kubeadm Upgrade Commands:

Upgrade the node using kubeadm upgrade. The specific commands depend on your current version and the target version.


# On each node
kubeadm upgrade plan  # View upgrade plan
kubeadm upgrade apply v<new-version>



Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:

Upgrade the kubelet and kubectl binaries on each node.



# On each node
systemctl restart kubelet




Uncordon Nodes:

Once the node upgrade is complete, uncordon the nodes to allow scheduling new pods.


kubectl uncordon <node-name>

kubectl uncordon <node-name>


Verify Upgrade:


Check Control Plane Components:

Ensure that control plane components are running the expected version.


kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


Check Nodes:

Verify that all nodes are in a "Ready" state.

kubectl get nodes


Test Applications:

Test your applications to ensure they are functioning correctly after the upgrade.



Rolling Back:

Rollback Control Plane:

If issues arise after the upgrade, you may need to roll back the control plane components.


kubeadm upgrade undo


2. Rollback Nodes:

To roll back nodes, you may need to restore the previous version of the kubelet and kubectl binaries.

Backup and Restore:

If needed, restore from the backup created before the upgrade.



=================================================================================

kubectl drain:

The kubectl drain command is used to gracefully evict all pods from a node, preparing it for maintenance or decommission. It cordons the node to prevent new pods from being scheduled on it and then starts evicting existing pods.


kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets


<node-name> is the name of the node you want to drain.
--ignore-daemonsets flag is used to ignore DaemonSet-managed pods, ensuring that essential system pods are not evicted.
After draining, the node is cordoned, and new pods won't be scheduled on it until it is uncordoned.



kubectl cordon:

The kubectl cordon command is used to mark a node as unschedulable, preventing new pods from being scheduled on it. Existing pods on the node continue to run.


kubectl cordon <node-name>

<node-name> is the name of the node you want to cordon.
After cording a node, it won't accept new pod assignments until it is uncordoned.





kubectl uncordon:

The kubectl uncordon command is used to mark a node as schedulable again, allowing new pods to be scheduled on it.


kubectl uncordon <node-name>



<node-name> is the name of the node you want to uncordon.
After uncordoning, the node becomes available for new pod assignments. It's typically used after maintenance or upgrades when you want to resume scheduling on the node.
