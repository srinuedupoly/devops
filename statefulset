In Kubernetes, a StatefulSet is a higher-level abstraction that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of pods. Unlike a Deployment, which is suitable for stateless applications, a StatefulSet is designed for stateful applications, such as databases, where each pod has a unique identifier and stable network identity.


Key features of StatefulSets include:

Stable Network Identity: StatefulSets give each pod a unique and stable hostname, such as <StatefulSetName>-<OrdinalIndex>. This allows for easy identification and communication between pods.

Ordered Deployment and Scaling: Pods in a StatefulSet are created and scaled in a deterministic and ordered manner. This is important for stateful applications where the order of pod creation or scaling matters.

Persistent Storage: StatefulSets can be used with Persistent Volumes (PVs) to provide stable storage for the pods. Each pod in a StatefulSet can have its own persistent storage.

Headless Service: By default, a StatefulSet creates a headless service to control the network domain of the pods. This allows for stable DNS resolution for each pod.

Here's a simple example of a StatefulSet manifest:



=====================

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
